Part 6: Timing Comparison and Explanation

Measured times (seconds):
  Part 1: 0.453162
  Part 2: 0.429466
  Part 3: 0.435754
  Part 4: 0.229508
  Part 5: 0.131722

Why times differ:
- Parallelism vs. core count: More threads use more CPU cores and reduce wall time up to available physical cores.
- Memory hierarchy and bandwidth: Multiple threads increase DRAM traffic; speedup tapers when memory bandwidth is saturated.
- Cache effects: Shared last-level cache between threads can reduce locality and add contention.
- Threading overhead and scheduling: Creating/joining threads adds small overhead; OS scheduling adds variance.
- SMT/Hyper-Threading: Threads beyond physical cores have diminishing returns since execution units are shared.

Expected trend:
- Parts 1, 2, 3 are similar (single-threaded work; Part 3 adds small thread overhead).
- Part 4 (2 threads) ~up to 2x faster on 2+ core CPUs.
- Part 5 (4 threads) ~up to 4x faster on 4+ core CPUs, limited by memory bandwidth/cache.
